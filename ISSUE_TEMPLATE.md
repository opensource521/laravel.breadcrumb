<!--
Bug reports only please.

This is not a support forum, and I don't have the time or energy to solve your problems for you.
If you don't understand something, read and re-read both the Laravel Breadcrumbs documentation
and the Laravel documentation until you do. Or hire a more experienced developer to help you.

If you have a very specific question (and you're super-polite about it) I may answer anyway.
If you just paste an error message and expect me to fix it, I definitely won't!

Thanks,
Dave
