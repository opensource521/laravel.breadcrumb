<!--
PLEASE NOTE:

This is not a support forum, and I don't have the time or energy to solve your problems for you.
If you don't understand something, read and re-read both the Laravel Breadcrumbs documentation
and the Laravel documentation until you do. Or hire a more experienced developer to help you.

If you don't like that, please remember this is free, open source software. The license even
says "The software is provided "as is", without warranty of any kind".

Thanks,
Dave
